Tricks With The Mouse
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Middle click a tab to close it.
Click and drag tabs to re-arrange their position.
Drag a tab away to make it a separate window.
Click and hold the mouse on the back or forward button on any tab to see the history of that particular tab.
If you want to run a search query using copied text, right click and use “Paste and Search” No need  of pasting it first and then hitting enter or clicking “Go” to run the query.
If the text you copied is a web page, open a new tab and right click on the address bar to get “Paste and Go”, saves you one keystroke / mouse click each time !
To zoom in or zoom out on a page (to increase font size etc) hold the control key and scroll using mouse. Scrolling forward zooms in, while scrolling backward zooms out. Ctrl + 0 brings the page back to the default zoom level.
Any text area ( like a comment form on a blog ) if you need more space, click and drag on the bottom-right corner to re-size the box to your choice. (Note: Website owners can disable this feature with some coding. If the website has disabled this feature, you will not be able to re-size the field.
After downloading a file, you can copy it to the desktop or to any other folder by just  dragging them directly from Google Chrome’s downloads bar ( yes, that small bar at  the bottom of the page with download progress, when you are downloading a file ) You can drag a file from this downloads bar to upload files as well. For example, you downloaded a photo your friend sent to you via email. While it is still showing on your downloads bar, open Google Drive or Dropbox (or any website that supports drag and drop to upload). Drag the file from the downloads bar directly in to the upload field to start the upload.
Easily bookmark a page clicking the “star” icon on the right end of the addressbar. You can do this with the keyboard shortcut “Ctrl + D” too.

 10 Tips for Developers

To search scripts, stylesheets and snippets by filename you can use: * Ctrl + O (Windows) * Cmd + O (Mac OSX)

Miscellaneous Chrome Tips
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right click any tab and select Pin tab to “save” it. Save? Yes, Chrome will remember the tabs you pinned and open them next time you open Chrome. Chrome will arrange pinned tabs to the extreme left of your Chrome windows.
Another use for Pinned Tab: You already know about pinned tab on Chrome. I use it for two more things. When I pin a tab, the close button goes off, and I will not accidentally close it.
Ctrl + Shift + D – Saves all open pages as bookmarks in a new folder.
Right click any tab for additional options like – Close tab to the right, and close all other tabs etc.
Right click and select Duplicate tab to create a new tab with same webpage.
Fake your location on Chrome.
Reduce volume of Chrome (not your entire computer)
Visit chrome://extensions and click on ‘view permissions’ on any extension to view permissions allowed to the extension.
To view Google cache of any webpage, try cache:website.com. For example, cache:chromestory.com to view cache of chromestory.com, straight from your Chrome omnibar (addressbar)
